      <h1>The Model T</h1>
      <p>THE MODEL T IS FORD’S UNIVERSAL CAR THAT PUT THE WORLD ON WHEELS.</p>
      <p>The Model T was introduced to the world in 1908. Henry Ford wanted the Model T to be affordable, simple to
        operate, and durable. The vehicle was one of the first mass production vehicles, allowing Ford to achieve his
        aim of manufacturing the universal car. Due to the mass production of the vehicle, Ford Motor Company could sell
        the vehicle for between $260 and $850 as Henry Ford passed production savings on to his customers.</p>

      <p>The Model T first tested by Henry Ford himself, became famous for its capability to perform stunts like
        climbing the stairs of the Tennessee State Capitol and reaching the top of Pikes Peak. The revolutionary vehicle
        saw the placement of the steering wheel on the left side, which became a standard practice in the industry.</p>
      <p>A common myth is that all model T’s were black. While Henry Ford did say, “Any customer can have a car painted
        any color that he wants so long as it’s black,” this policy was in place solely for efficiency and uniformity.
        The car was only offered in black from 1914-1925. Before and after that, it was available in various colors
        including blue, red, grey, and green.</p>
      <p>The vehicle also became famous for its unique nickname—Tin Lizzie. By the early 1920s, more than half of the
        registered automobiles in the world were Fords. More than 15,000,000 Model T's were built and sold.</p>
