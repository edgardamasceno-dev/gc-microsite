# Project 1 (Micro-Site)
### Georgian College - 24W HTML, CSS, & JS Fundamentals - 205

## Description
On your own, design and develop a small website promoting an actual product or service that was on the market before the Internet. For example, what would a website designed to sell the very first transistor radio in the early 20th century look like if they had the Internet back then? Make it convincing.

## Instructions
- **Choose a Product/Service**: Decide on an old product or service that was on the market before the Internet.
- **Gather Materials**: Assemble or collect some promotional copy and images.
- **Design Your Site**: Arrange the content into the following four pages:
  - **Homepage**: General information, corporate information.
  - **About the Product/Service**: What makes this thing so great?
  - **Product Promotions**: Details about the product, current promotions.
  - **Contact Info**: Contact information, order form.

### Development Requirements:
- Construct the above pages into well-formed, valid HTML.
- Decide on an appropriate file/folder naming strategy.
- Include on each page a list of links to provide consistent global navigation across the site.
- Include a simple customer feedback form of some type.
- Add some simple JavaScript interaction.
- Use appropriate HTML elements to structure your content.
- Construct an external CSS file to handle background images, typography, color, and layout.
- Comment all code where appropriate (HTML/CSS/JavaScript).
- Format your code so that it is easy to read and maintain.
- Have someone proofread your completed site for spelling and grammar.
- Ensure that all code is YOUR OWN. Do not simply take the provided example code from class and change the content and some CSS - the instructor needs to see your own work.

## Take It Further
- Attempt some interesting layout effects with CSS.
- Anything else you can think of â€¦ but make sure it is your own work.
